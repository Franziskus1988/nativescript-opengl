# nativescript-opengl
Try to run opengl in a nativescript app

With native (Java) implementation (native\GlRenderer) of GLSurfaceview.Renderer the OpenGL rendering works, but the TypeScript implementation (src\app\opengl\GLRenderer.ts) doesn't work.

I'm grateful to anyone who can help fix this, since I have a working WebGL implementation of a rendering for special data and like to port this to Nativescript + OpenGL.
